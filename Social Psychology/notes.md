## Formulate Theory
What's causing the cause of the study

1. Formulate hypothesis
    - People who are intoxicated will show less motor coordination
1. Design study
    - Plan an experiment in which you give alcohol to one group and no alcohol to a control group. Alternatively, compare people before and after drinking alcohol
1. Collect the data
    - Give people alcohol and measure motor coordination and balance. Select tasks that are appropriate to collect this information
1. Analyze data
    - Use statistical techniques to access whether the results are genuine or a probably due to chance
1. Disseminate the results
    - Report on the findings in a research journal or at a conference

### Theory definition: Theory vs. Phenomenon
Theory development:

- Inductive: specific to general (e.g. Kitty Geno)
    - You go from something very specific first. 
    - Kitty Geno case is when a woman was murdered, but no one really reported--"I could see other people witnessing"
    - After this specific incident happened, they wanted to know why this happened in metropolitan area.
    - Bystander effect - Individual vs group
    - Most common way theories get developed in social psychology

- Deductive: general to specific (eg. ego depletion)
    - Different findings from different areas -> tries to find a common thread within this settings
    - Ego depletion (by Roy Baumeister)
        - When it is cognitively / emotionally draining, people will give up. (general observation)
        - People have such limited energy (ego) -- when egos get depleted, self control is typically impaired


Study should be theoretical, since phenomenon is something happening but not knowing why

### Theory Evaluation:
- Testable / Falsifiable 
    - Good theories must be testable
    - Freud's Ego vs Superego theory
        - Wasn't really testable since there was no way to measure unconsciousness
- Fits data
- Parsimony
    - Few assumptions is usually better than more complicated ones
    - Hans the horse calculating numbers
- Generates research
    - Interests other people in the research
    - More method, interest = research


Usually Phenomenon -> Theory

## Background issues for research methods

1. Design: Experimental vs. Correlational
1. Validity: Internal vs. External
1. Measurement Issues
    1. operationalization
    1. manipulation checks

### Design

#### Experimental

Goal: trying to find the cause

- Manipulate (independent variable)
    - Number of people, etc
- Measure (dependent variable)
    - behavioral, survey, reactions, etc

- Random assignment key
    - Randomly assigned to random subjects
    - Eliminating a form of bias
- Control key
    - Environment is usually controlled
    - Ex) color of the room
- Standardization
    - How anybody from the research team is interacting with the subject
    - Ex) talking the instruction differently to each subject
        - Could use a recording of the instruction to remove the bias


#### Correlational

Goal: measuring variables and finding relationships

- Relation Between variables -1 0 +1
    - -1 : opposite relationship; A goes up, B goes down
    - 0 : there is NO systematic relationship
    - 1 : there is relationship; A goes up, B goes up
- Trying to see if variables are systematically relational to each other

- No Causation
    - Nothing is being manipulated, so you can't talk about causation
- Path Analysis
    - Its aim is to provide estimates of the magnitude and significance of hypothesised causal connections between sets of variables
    - Like a funnel?

### Validity

#### Internal Validity

Degree you are sure the cause of the results. Basically, you know what you're doing and the cause

#### External Validity

What people think: whether my results here would happen in the real world

What the prof. thinks: degree to which, the subjects (whatever you're measuring) is acting / happening naturally

This doesn't mean we can't have external validity in laboratory experiments. 

**Deception**. Subjects are usually tricked into thinking that the experiment is something else

**Natural**. Do things out in the real world where people don't know they're being tested

## Measurement Issues

1. operationalization
1. manipulation checks

### Operationalization

How do you represent variables in a research? 

- Independent Variables
    - Choosing which independent variable to manipulate.
- Dependent Variables

Hypothetical concepts like Love, is very hard to measure and operationalization is really important

### Manipulation Checks

Checking if the manipulation was successful. For example, timing the subject to create anxiety can be checked by measuring the heartbeat

## Research Methods: Pro's & Con's

### Laboratory
1.	Subjects sign up for study and know they are going to be in a study, you assign them randomly to a condition, manipulate independent variable and measure dependent variable
1.	Talk about causation if you have good control, standardization of instructions
1.	Behavior may not be naturally occurring and may not generalize how people behave in the real world
1.	Use deception so people are led to believe the study is about one thing when it is actually about another thing
1.	The manipulation is not known to the people
    1.	Example: you are told that we are interested in interpersonal perception. People will act as interviewers and applicants. Ask people questions and evaluate them. See how you perform if you are an applicant. In one study, they manipulated how heavy the clipboard that the interviewer held was. People who had a heavy clipboard rated their applicants much more strongly than people holding a lighter clipboard. In another study, they manipulated the chair you sat in as the interviewer. If you sat in a sturdy, hard chair, you rated the applicant strongly. If you sat in a plushy chair, you rated the applicant not as strong.

### Observational
1. Observing  naturally occurring behavior in a real world environment
1.	Go into it with hypothesis and a clear coding strategy to measure the variables in the exact same way
    1.	Example: "the girls get prettier at closing time". Observational study of people in a bar. Opposite sex flirting by guys and attractiveness of girls they were flirting will as it got closer to closing time. System for randomly choosing which guys they would follow (every fifth guy who came in alone). What constituted flirting behavior? Cross-cultural research talks about facing the person vs. turned sideways, mutual eye gaze, touching, 
    1.	women "head cant" 
1.	Cannot talk about causation because you are not manipulating anything
1.	Doing observations in uncontrolled setting, so things can go wrong
1. Can only be done in public behavior.

### Field Experiment
1.	Attempt to manipulate an independent setting and measure a dependent variable in a real world setting
1.	Subjects do not know they are in a study
1.	Example: pick-up truck with a gun rack in the back. Drive the truck around back to one particular light until there was only one car behind them with one person in it. There was either a gun or contractor's level in the gun rack.  Light turns green and truck doesn't go. They measured how aggressive (did they honk the horn? How long did they honk for? How many times did they honk? Did they yell?) the person behind the truck was. People were more aggressive when there was a gun in the back. Gun activates part of your brain associated with aggression.  
1.	You can talk about causation to a certain extent
1.	Also there is a certain extent of external validity because subjects are unaware that they are in a study
1.	Issues of ethics
    1.	People are in a psychology study who haven't given consent to being in a psychology study
        1.	You have to make sure that the behavior is naturally occurring in an every day setting
1. Can only be done in public behavior.

### Survey
1. Very easy to collect a lot of data in a short period of time
1. People lie about what they report. They want be perceived as a better person. 
1. Make sure surveys are not tied down to identity to eliminate conscious bias
    1. Make surveys anonymous
1. Unconscious bias
    1. There are people who never give an extreme response
        1. From 1-10, they would always select some option in the middle
    1. In a rush to get through the survey
        1. Ask a few questions in a dynamically posed way
1. Surveys are **passive**
    1. Observing behavior is infinitely better than receiving a passive response

### Experience Sampling

## Formulate Theory
What's causing the cause of the study

1. Formulate hypothesis
    - People who are intoxicated will show less motor coordination
1. Design study
    - Plan an experiment in which you give alcohol to one group and no alcohol to a control group. Alternatively, compare people before and after drinking alcohol
1. Collect the data
    - Give people alcohol and measure motor coordination and balance. Select tasks that are appropriate to collect this information
1. Analyze data
    - Use statistical techniques to access whether the results are genuine or a probably due to chance
1. Disseminate the results
    - Report on the findings in a research journal or at a conference

### Theory definition: Theory vs. Phenomenon
Theory development:

- Inductive: specific to general (e.g. Kitty Geno)
    - You go from something very specific first. 
    - Kitty Geno case is when a woman was murdered, but no one really reported--"I could see other people witnessing"
    - After this specific incident happened, they wanted to know why this happened in metropolitan area.
    - Bystander effect - Individual vs group
    - Most common way theories get developed in social psychology

- Deductive: general to specific (eg. ego depletion)
    - Different findings from different areas -> tries to find a common thread within this settings
    - Ego depletion (by Roy Baumeister)
        - When it is cognitively / emotionally draining, people will give up. (general observation)
        - People have such limited energy (ego) -- when egos get depleted, self control is typically impaired


Study should be theoretical, since phenomenon is something happening but not knowing why

### Theory Evaluation:
- Testable / Falsifiable 
    - Good theories must be testable
    - Freud's Ego vs Superego theory
        - Wasn't really testable since there was no way to measure unconsciousness
- Fits data
- Parsimony
    - Few assumptions is usually better than more complicated ones
    - Hans the horse calculating numbers
- Generates research
    - Interests other people in the research
    - More method, interest = research


Usually Phenomenon -> Theory

## Background issues for research methods

1. Design: Experimental vs. Correlational
1. Validity: Internal vs. External
1. Measurement Issues
    1. operationalization
    1. manipulation checks

### Design

#### Experimental

Goal: trying to find the cause

- Manipulate (independent variable)
    - Number of people, etc
- Measure (dependent variable)
    - behavioral, survey, reactions, etc

- Random assignment key
    - Randomly assigned to random subjects
    - Eliminating a form of bias
- Control key
    - Environment is usually controlled
    - Ex) color of the room
- Standardization
    - How anybody from the research team is interacting with the subject
    - Ex) talking the instruction differently to each subject
        - Could use a recording of the instruction to remove the bias


#### Correlational

Goal: measuring variables and finding relationships

- Relation Between variables -1 0 +1
    - -1 : opposite relationship; A goes up, B goes down
    - 0 : there is NO systematic relationship
    - 1 : there is relationship; A goes up, B goes up
- Trying to see if variables are systematically relational to each other

- No Causation
    - Nothing is being manipulated, so you can't talk about causation
- Path Analysis
    - Its aim is to provide estimates of the magnitude and significance of hypothesised causal connections between sets of variables
    - Like a funnel?

### Validity

#### Internal Validity

Degree you are sure the cause of the results. Basically, you know what you're doing and the cause

#### External Validity

What people think: whether my results here would happen in the real world

What the prof. thinks: degree to which, the subjects (whatever you're measuring) is acting / happening naturally

This doesn't mean we can't have external validity in laboratory experiments. 

**Deception**. Subjects are usually tricked into thinking that the experiment is something else

**Natural**. Do things out in the real world where people don't know they're being tested

## Formulate Theory
What's causing the cause of the study

1. Formulate hypothesis
    - People who are intoxicated will show less motor coordination
1. Design study
    - Plan an experiment in which you give alcohol to one group and no alcohol to a control group. Alternatively, compare people before and after drinking alcohol
1. Collect the data
    - Give people alcohol and measure motor coordination and balance. Select tassks that are appropriate to collect this information
1. Analyze data
    - Use statistical techniques to access whether the results are genuine
1. Disemminate the results

Theory definition: Theory vs. Phenomenon
Theory development:

- Inductive: specific to general (e.g. Kitty Geno)
    - You go from something very specific first. 
    - Kitty Geno case is when a woman was murdered, but no one really reported--"I could see other people witnessing"
    - After this specific incident happened, they wanted to know why this happened in metropolitan area.
    - Bystander effect - Individual vs group
    - Most common way theories get developed in social psychology

- Deductive: general to specific (eg. ego depletion)
    - Different findings from different areas -> tries to find a common thread within this settings
    - Ego depletion (by Roy Baumeister)
        - When it is cognitively / emotionally draining, people will give up. (general observation)
        - People have such limited energy (ego) -- when egos get depleted, self control is typically impaired


Study should be theoretical, since phenomenon is something happening but not knowing why

Theory Evaluation:
- Testable / Falsifiable 
    - Good theories must be testable
    - Freud's Ego vs Superego theory
        - Wasn't really testable since there was no way to measure unconsciousness
- Fits data
- Parsimony
    - Few assumptions is usually better than more complicated ones
    - Hans the horse calculating numbers
- Generates research
    - Interests other people in the research
    - More method, interest = research


Usually Phenomenon -> Theory
